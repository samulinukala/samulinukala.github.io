                <h1> Challenges</h1>
                <p> This was the first game where I used version control. I lost files 5 times but then i improved my skills. I was also quite inexperienced when I made this game but I learned alot from making it. One of the biggest challenges to making it was with version control. I lost the level 5 times because I was inexperienced with Github. I did learn my lesson and learned to put my changes to Github almost always </p>

                <h1> Self reflection </h1>
                <p> It is ok quality for one of the first games I have made. There are many things that could have been done better. Biggest thing was that could have been improved would have been to make the movement use rigid body instead of translating the position. </p>
