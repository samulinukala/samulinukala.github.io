                <h1> Description</h1>
                <p>  In this game, you fly a UFO trying to collide with characters walking on the ground randomly. You must dodge a volley of bullets fired at you. The level takes place in a bedroom frozen in time in the middle of a ghost attack. The game is made in Unreal Engine. </p>

                <h1> Features </h1>
                <p> Flying with WASD. Control to slow down. Shift to speed up. The most impressive thing to me that I made was the turrets. I got them to turn around towards the player and shoot bullets. I balanced the game, so you would most of the time have to bank to one side, so the bullets would not hit the UFO. </p>

                <h1> Challenges</h1>
                <p> This was the first game I made in Unreal Engine, so it took a while to figure out how to do everything. Unreal is also quite a bit faster to make impressive games. The games look much better than Unity with less effort.</p>

                <h1> Self reflection </h1>
                <p> It turned out surprisingly good. The idea was to make a game where you fly freely dodging shot coming from canons and that goal succeeded. Making good-looking games in Unreal Engine seems much easier than in Unity. I did not code anything making this game. I used the node system. This was new for me.</p>
