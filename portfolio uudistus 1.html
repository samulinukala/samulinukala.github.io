                <h1> Description</h1>
                <p> this is the culmimation of my experiences making this website. the project has covered everything forward of the first project. </p>

                <h1> Features </h1>
                <p> during this entire time writing reports for few of these sites i did add some code previews that are pictures at the bottom i even tried going fancy with pdf embaedding. but lack of progress and will to make this website is always there so it was abondoned. i added a summary page of the projects with videos which i think is sorta fun. the website has three main pages front page, summary page and a list page. under those are the actual projects. I did draw icons for links at the front. which was fun</p>

            <div id="c3">
                <h1> Challenges</h1>
                <p> problems come donw mostly to lack of clear errors and that causing there to be no motivation to waste who knows how long looking for fantom errors. that combined with the fact that i have to write a report really brings it down even further. Doing the videos and screenshots can be fun enough to tolerate but writing is not fun. beyond the writing itself the have not been that many challenges if i don't try to make actual changes. </p>

                <h1> Self reflection </h1>
                <p> I hate updating this website. html is hard to do for me and i hate that i have to update two files which makes this really slow. i have not learned much nor does this website even remotly look passable but i at least tried. certainly not my thing. i an do it but it is not fun.</p>
