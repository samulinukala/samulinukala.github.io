                <h1> Description</h1>
                <p> In this game, you play as a bird that tries to fly through the opening between two pipes. The enjoyment in the game comes from trying to beat your score. There is no progression in the game other than getting more bragging rights as you score higher. This game was made with another student. We made the game by having a weekly meeting where we discussed the direction of the game and made it together. During the meeting, we decided what we would complete at our own time.
                    for the next meeting.</p>

                <h1> Features </h1>
                <p> In the game, you can switch your bird in the menu and game over screen with numerical buttons. 1 gives you the pink bird. 2 gives you the cool bird. 3 gives you the sun bird. The obstacles spawn randomly according to limitations set to them. The background moves and teleports when it gets to the half point </p>

                <h1> Challenges</h1>
                <p> My responsibilities were spawner, start screen, end screen, point calculation, player switch and the background. I also tried to make a leaderboard, but it was difficult, so I gave up on the idea. Making the game difficulty just right was a challenge. The spawner values controlled the spawning of the pipes and were randomly picked when I made it. It took a while to get it right. When the player switch script was added, it caused problems in other scripts. The scripts did not work because they could not find the player at the start of the script. It was fixed by having the script look for the player constantly. The background was made from an image that needed to be edited in order for it to loop properly. I did this by doubling it and editing the edge to be compatible. You can still see the transition if you search for it, but it does not jump at your eyes. </p>
