                <h1> Challenges</h1>
                <p> I was inexperienced as a developer, so I had to invent workarounds for my lacking talents. I did not know how to make a UI cover the camera, so I destroyed the player and switched to another camera with the UI attached to it. While testing, I accidentally removed the prefab folder and all of my prefabs from the scene stopped working. I was broken in spirit, but I stared making the prefabs again and placed them on the scene. The game became too difficult because I made too  many mines and made them smaller. The camera remained janky because I did not have the capabilities to make it better. Making a controller for the camera was quite hard. I did not get the camera to rotate around the player, the camera only spun around the back of the player.  </p>

                <h1> Self reflection </h1>
                <p> I think I did good considering this was the first game I made. I am happy with the result. Making this game broadened my understanding of game production. I did not have a team to make this game with, but I could ask help from discord if I had needed to. I would grade this as 3/5. It is a mess, but it's adequate. I did my best making this game. </p>
