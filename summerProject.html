                <h1> Description</h1>
                <p> During the summer, I did a few miscellaneous things. This is a page that gathers these random things together. </p>

                <h1> Low poly models </h1>
                <p> They were made for an idea for a drawing doll. That could help me better understand how to draw people better. The idea did not go further, since there was already an app that did what I wanted, and I bought it. The models are a pistol and an assault rifle. I watched the tutorial at the same time while making the models. I have taken an extra course on modelling with blender. I think it is just something that I don't like to do that much, but still a useful skill to have. I have no real passion for modelling. I might get a passion for it if i learned it more. Studying modelling helps to understand how to use the models in games. These were suppoed to be props for the app. The project didn't really start any further than that.</p>

                <h1> Uraj√§rven kartanon mysteeri Update and IOS version</h1>
                <p> I updated the UI scaling and built an IOS version. The IOS version was pretty good, but the updated Google play version wasn't that good. The scaling left massive borders on the sides, which caused the gam screen to be small. The game was already quite hard because the pictures were small on the phone screen. Apple development was quite annoying because it could only be done on a Mac and to test the app you had to have an Apple phone or a tablet. So you need minimum of 2 devices from apple. I had to remotely control them with tool because I don't own Apple devices. The Unity project is also not a finished project, it is only a Xcode export. The feedback from Apple was good and helpful, and they helped find bugs.</p>

                <h1> Ship Startup festival </h1>
                <p> I participated on that festival. I was part of it as ometta softworks as coder. In the picture on the right I have circled me from the youtubevideo about 2022 ship startup festival. We got elimited in the first round. I got some info on how to get funding for a project. In that way it was a good experience. I took part in it for two days. There were few interesting seminars on how to pitch games. Ship festival had a good thing where you could have a meeting with successful entranepur.</p>
