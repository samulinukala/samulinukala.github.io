                <h1> Description</h1>
                <p> The game has a short story that takes some liberties from reality to tell the story of the brother and the sister living in the mansion. 
                    In the story Lilly and Hugo prepare for dinner with the ladys from the womens assosiation and decide to make hold a play in their home. 
                    Things start disappearing and rooms become a mess. 
                    At the end it is revealed that a ghost is responsible for the mayhem. 
                    the ghost is called sofia and she was the maid for the mansion before dying. 
                    The real museum is said to have a ghost that appears to visitors and staff. 
                    During the time that the siblings were alive at their mansion it was a cultural center where allsorts events happend.

                <h1> Features </h1>
                <p> The game has six levels. Each level has three items that can be found. When you complete the level you get an item and it gets harder because next time you have to find ten more items. There are three difficulty levels. The game has a two minute timelimit. In total there are eighteen items that can be found. Those items are on show in the museum.</p>

                <h1> Challenges</h1>
                <p> The first mistake I made was because the name of the project was Urajärven Kartanon mysteeri which had the letter ä. Because of that I could not get the app to build an android version. Next problem was making the item randomiser because I tried making the randomiser too fancy I wasted week on it. I did learn that when going back in github saves can make the project fall apart. I fixed it by putting multiple versions together to make a frankenstein project that worked. Lot of bugs were unnoticed because I did not test the whole app through. </p>

                <h1> Self reflection </h1>
                <p> In my opinion I execed myself while making the app. I did learn how making games works in practice 2and how well teamwork goes when you communicate with your team mates. I also learned a bit about how gamedesigners work and design things. One of the lessons that I learned is that at some point you just have to accept what you have made if it is functional and not waste resources on it if most player won't even notice it. While I did make an app that I am proud of I did multiple times face problems because I am still lacking the skills to make fancier coding tricks that would make the code more efficent and better. I also learned to ask help when I am stuck. All and all during the internship I reinforced my basic coding skills and I am proud of the finnished product.</p>

                <p> 
                    I made this game with the help of Justyna Neuvonen during XAMK Proto Studio intership. She made the graphics and I
                    programmed it.
